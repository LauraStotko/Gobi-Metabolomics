# Load data
Downloading the bulk data from humet.org as either a csv or an excel file was simple, but the names were swapped, making the files unable to be processed by rstudio. Simply changing the extension solved this issue.
```{r}
data_path <-"../data/raw/postprandial_non_imputed.csv"
info_path <- "../data/raw/postprandial_info.csv"
data <- read.csv(data_path, sep = ";")
info <- read.csv(info_path, sep = ";")

# Filter out non-plasma data points from info
info_plasma <- info %>% filter(Fluid == "plasma")

# Add targeted / non-targeted column in info
info_plasma <- cbind(targeted = )




# Merge data and info by metabolite
#merged_data <- merge(data, info, by = "metabolite")

#data_long <- data %>% pivot_longer(cols = -c(time, subject), # exclude time and subject columns
 #                                  names_to = "metabolite", # name for the metabolite column
  #                                 values_to = "value") # name for the metabolite values

#merged_data <- left_join(data_long, info, by = "metabolite")
